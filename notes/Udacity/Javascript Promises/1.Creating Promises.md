## Synchronous , Asynchronus 이해하기
```
--Synchronous
One statement exeutes and there is a guarntee that the next statement executes imediately afterwards.

const sync = 'test'
console.log(sync)

--Asynchronus
Async code is not guaranteed to execute in a single unbroken timeline.
we cannot assume when async operations will complete.

```

## To handle async, we need promise

```
-old way ,use callback fucntion

1. It does not handle errors, network, database, javascirpt... properly
2. neted callbaks within call backs. => call back hell

```

## Primise Timeline

A promise can only settle once.
```js
new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  console.log('first');
  resolve(value);
  reject(error)
  console.log('second'); // can't happen ad second time
}).then(function(value) {
  console.log('third');
})catch(error => console.log(error))
})
```
