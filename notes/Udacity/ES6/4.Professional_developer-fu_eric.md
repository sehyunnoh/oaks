# Polyfill
```js
if (!String.prototype.startsWith) {
  String.prototype.startsWith = function (searchString, position) {
    position = position || 0;
    return this.substr(position, searchString.length) === searchString;
  };
}

# Transpiling
> change to target code (still human-readable)
## Babel
> Babel's original name was slightly more descriptive - 6to5. This was because, originally, Babel converted ES6 code to ES5 code
> It'll convert ES6 to ES5, JSX to JavaScript, and Flow to JavaScript.
